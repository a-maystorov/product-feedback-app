## 👁‍🗨 Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

    ✅ View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
    ✅ See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
    ✅ Create, read, update, and delete product feedback requests
    ✅ Receive form validations when trying to create/edit feedback requests
    ✅ Sort suggestions by most/least upvotes and most/least comments
    ✅ Filter suggestions by category
    ✅ Add comments and replies to a product feedback request
    ✅ Upvote product feedback requests
    ❌ **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

### 📚 What I learned

This was a very fun project to build and the whole process was a huge learning experience, from managing state, conditional rendering, passing props, routing, working with arrays and so much more. I would need to write a full blog post about every single detail. 😆

Throughout the project one piece of code that I am very happy how it worked out and pround of is the way I handled sorting the suggestions by category and other criteria:
**Note: I am not sure if this is the most optimal or efficient way to solve this problem but this was what I was able to come up with and I stuck with it... 😅**

```js
const [currentCategory, setCurrentCategory] = useState('all');
const [currentSortCriteria, setCurrentSortCriteria] = useState('Most Upvotes');

const changeCategory = (newCategory) => setCurrentCategory(newCategory);
const changeSortCriteria = (newCriteria) => setCurrentSortCriteria(newCriteria);

const sortedSuggestions = suggestionRequests
  ? suggestionRequests.sort((a, b) => {
      const commentsA = a.comments ? a.comments.length : 0;
      const commentsB = b.comments ? b.comments.length : 0;

      const repliesA = a.comments ? a.comments : [];
      const filteredRepliesA = repliesA.filter((comment) => {
        return comment.replies ? comment.replies : null;
      });

      const repliesB = b.comments ? b.comments : [];
      const filteredRepliesB = repliesB.filter((comment) => {
        return comment.replies ? comment.replies : null;
      });

      const repliesLengthA = filteredRepliesA[0]
        ? filteredRepliesA[0].replies.length
        : 0;
      const repliesLengthB = filteredRepliesB[0]
        ? filteredRepliesB[0].replies.length
        : 0;

      const A = commentsA + repliesLengthA;
      const B = commentsB + repliesLengthB;

      switch (currentSortCriteria) {
        case 'Most Upvotes':
          return b.upvotes - a.upvotes;
        case 'Least Upvotes':
          return a.upvotes - b.upvotes;
        case 'Most Comments':
          return B - A;
        case 'Least Comments':
          return A - B;
        default:
          return b.upvotes - a.upvotes;
      }
    })
  : null;

const suggestions = sortedSuggestions
  ? sortedSuggestions.filter((suggestion) => {
      switch (currentCategory) {
        case 'all':
          return true;
        case 'UI':
        case 'UX':
        case 'enhancement':
        case 'bug':
        case 'feature':
          return suggestion.category === currentCategory;
        default:
          return true;
      }
    })
  : null;
```

### 🔍 Useful resources

- [SPA with GH-Pages](https://github.com/rafgraph/spa-github-pages) - This was a very useful resource when deploying a SPA to GH-Pages since it does not support React SPA's natively. Huge props to the author, helped me alot during the deployment process.
